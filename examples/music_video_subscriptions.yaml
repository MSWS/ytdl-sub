# The pattern for this preset is
#   - "Album Title | Video Title"
#   - "https://..."
#   - "Album Title | Video Title"
#   - "https://..."
#    ...
#
# For Kodi + Plex, the Album Title can be anything.
# For Plex, the Album Title must be one of the following:
#   - behindthescenes
#   - concert
#   - interview
#   - live
#   - lyrics
#   - video
# to conform to their naming convention found here:
# https://support.plex.tv/articles/205568377-adding-local-artist-and-music-videos/
# You will get a regex error if it's not set correctly.
#
# Video Title is optional. It will use that title instead of the video's actual title.
# Note that this should be only used on URLS that link to a single video, otherwise
# every video in a playlist gets the same title.
